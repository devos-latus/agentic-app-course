# Implementation Workflow

## Core Process

1. **Think Deeply**: Analyze the question thoroughly, focus on the core requirement, avoid unnecessary additions
2. **Propose Implementation**: Present clear explanation of what will be implemented and why
3. **Wait for Approval**: Do not implement until user explicitly approves the approach
4. **Execute**: Only after approval, proceed with clean, focused implementation

## Rules

- No code implementation without prior explanation and approval
- **Always reference README.md** for project scope and requirements
- Focus only on what's documented in README - avoid adding undocumented features
- **Write focused unit tests** for any new file, feature, or functionality to validate it works as required
- Present reasoning before action
- Keep explanations concise but complete
