## 🔍 Detailed Test Results

### 1. Missing Column Handling
**LLM Judge Score: 10/10**

**Test Scenario:** User asks "What is the average salary in the products table?"
- ✅ **Immediate Problem Identification**: "salary is not commonly a column in a products table"
- ✅ **Clear Guidance**: Offers to show available columns
- ✅ **Smart Suggestions**: Recommends checking employees table for salary data
- ✅ **User-Friendly**: No technical jargon, conversational tone

**Judge Feedback:**
> "The system immediately identified that 'salary' is not a typical or existing column in the products table. It clearly stated the column 'salary' is missing. It proactively offered to show the available columns in the products table, aiding user recovery."

### 2. Non-Numeric Data Handling  
**LLM Judge Score: 10/10**

**Test Scenario:** User asks "Calculate the average name in the products table"
- ✅ **Perfect Type Detection**: Recognizes 'name' is a text column
- ✅ **Clear Explanation**: "Calculating an average only works for numeric values"
- ✅ **Alternative Suggestions**: Suggests other numeric columns or different statistics
- ✅ **Recovery Support**: Offers to show column list for informed choice

**Judge Feedback:**
> "The system correctly detects that 'name' is a text column. It explicitly states that averages can only be computed for numeric columns. It suggests clear alternatives: Choose another numeric column, consider a different statistic, such as 'count'."

### 3. Error Message Quality
**LLM Judge Score: 9/10**

**Test Scenarios:** Multiple error types tested
- ✅ **Consistent Excellence**: High quality across all error types
- ✅ **Specific Guidance**: Each message provides actionable next steps
- ✅ **User-Friendly Language**: No technical jargon or intimidating errors
- ✅ **Immediate Usefulness**: Users know exactly what to do next

**Judge Feedback:**
> "Error messages are clear, polite, and recoverable. Gentle and helpful, not technical. Each message includes both the error and what the user can do next."

**Improvement Suggestions:**
- Could immediately show available columns instead of offering to show them
- Could be more explicit about column types when known

### 4. Recovery and Learning Flow
**LLM Judge Score: 9.5/10**

**Test Scenario:** User makes error ("average cost") then corrects ("average price")
- ✅ **Clear Error Communication**: Lists available columns immediately
- ✅ **Smart Suggestions**: Proactively suggests 'price' as likely intended column
- ✅ **Successful Recovery**: User succeeds on retry with system guidance
- ✅ **Learning Support**: Error message teaches about available data structure

**Judge Feedback:**
> "This is an excellent example of robust error recovery and user learning support. The system diagnoses the user's issue, provides clear actionable alternatives, and supports a quick, successful retry."
